The Lizzie Soundpack modifies several ingame sounds pertaining to weapons, such as use sounds and hitsounds.

Several weapons that would ordinarily use the "woosh" sound have had a little variety added, based on their use time.

There is, additionally, a unique hitsound for at least every class, as well as some "generic" hitsounds for clauses not covered by other sounds.
